# Sorting Algorithms
A collection of various sorting algorithms implemented in Java.

All the various sorting algorithms are implemented in seperate classes - each in turn, a subclass of `Sort.java`. Custom ordering can be obtained by using a [`java.util.Comparator`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html).
